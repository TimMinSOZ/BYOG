BYOG - Build Your Own Grid - A Public Education Tool


Based on AEMO generator and interconnector data from Jan 2020 to May 2024 the program allows the build and design of a Electrical Grid.

It is State Based such that electricity can only move InterState via Interconnectors and the National Grid is the summary of the 5 State Grids in the NEM - NSW, QLD, SA, TAS, VIC

It may use any type of Generator and may define at a State / Plant / Generator level ie NSW Coal 5GW or NSW Eraring 3GW Mount Piper 2GW or NSW-Eraring-No1 is 750MW No2 is 750MW etc etc 
The difference is when applying the degree of granualisation from apply a single 5GW to 10 x Gens = 5GW and each generator behaving independently of the others in responding to Over or Under Supply
The generators available but not limited to Nuclear, Small Modular Nuclear, Coal Black, Coal Brown, Gas CCGT, Gas OCGT, Wind OnShore wind Offshore, Solar Grid, Solar Rooftop, Grid Batteries, House Batteries, EV Batteries and EV's, Interconnectors

The aim is to allow the user to build a grid using any generators they like and assess the grid graphically showing any shortages and over supply. The grid can be saved and later restored and worked on further.

The system will store multiple grids and allow comparison based on Capital Cost / Annual Cost / Lazards LCOE / CSIRO LCOE 

The core feature of the program is the level of graphics used to show Supply problems and is intended for the general public
